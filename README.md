# C Programming Language
C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language that is widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and application development. It is known for its efficiency and control over system resources.
  
*Learn C by practicing..*
*Enjoy solving the questions from a very basic level to a geek level!!*

Happy learning!! ðŸŒŸ


### Basic Concepts

- **Procedural Language**: C follows a procedural programming paradigm, focusing on the concept of procedures or functions to operate on data.

- **Low-Level Access**: C provides low-level access to memory through pointers, making it suitable for system-level programming.

- **Portability**: C code can be compiled and run on various platforms with minimal changes.

- **Standard Library**: C comes with a rich set of standard libraries that provide built-in functions for tasks such as input/output, string manipulation, and memory management.

### Compilation Process

C code undergoes a multi-step compilation process:

1. **Source Code**: You write your C code in `.c` files.

2. **Preprocessing**: The C Preprocessor (`cpp`) processes directives (e.g., `#include`, `#define`) and prepares the source code for compilation.

3. **Compilation**: The C Compiler (`gcc` or similar) compiles the preprocessed code into assembly code.

4. **Assembly**: The assembler converts the assembly code into machine code, generating an object file (`.o` or `.obj`).

5. **Linking**: The linker combines the object files and any required libraries to create the final executable.

### Key Components

- **Compiler**: A program that translates C source code into machine code. Popular compilers include GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) and Clang.

- **Linker**: A tool that combines various object files and libraries into a single executable.

- **Debugger**: A tool used to test and debug C programs. GDB (GNU Debugger) is a commonly used debugger for C.

### Example
Hereâ€™s a simple C program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
